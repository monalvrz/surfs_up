# Surfs_up

## Project Overview

This project consisted of an analysis of a dataset containing information about the climate of the island of Oahu in Hawaii, with the intention of providing information to an investor to consider opening a Surf n' Shake store on the island.

After performing an initial analysis of the data, the investor W. Avy requested a more thorough analysis of the temperature data for the months of June and December on Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Resources

## Results

After filtering the database to obtain only the data corresponding to the months of June and December, we performed a statistical summary that allows us to conclude the following:
